      <p>I'm a bored (and procrastinating) sophomore at CCA taking AP Computer Science. Partially because I forgot every scrap of HTML and CSS knowledge from the previous ECS course I took, my CSS is suspiciously similar to the CSS from my ECS HTML website. Above is a picture of a snowman I made in 5th grade in JS on Khan Academy, because I don't want to put my face there.</p>
